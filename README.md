# H1 The list of my favorite bash commands

1. **CD**

We use this command when we want to switch between different directories. Directory is the main thing in bash in order to execute. Directory in other words is folder.

2. **CLEAR**

We use this command in order to delete everything from the screen, i find it very useful. Because sometimes you put a lot of command in bash and it might be a little bit difficult to look for smth.

3. **PWD**

We use this command to check in which directory we are right now. AKA _print working directory_. Working directory means the directory where you are right now.

4. **MKDIR**

It means Make Directory. Basically we use this command when we want to create a directory.

5. **LS**

_LS_ means list. It shows all the files and folders in the directory. If you also want to see hidden files, you just add _-a_ to _ls_.
